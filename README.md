## Projects Overview

### 1. **Airport Simulation System**
- A priority-based simulation of airport operations.
- Features:
  - Plane queuing based on type and priority.
  - Tracks fuel consumption and plane statuses (e.g., landed, circling, crashed).
  - Interactive simulation with user-controlled loops and updates.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
  - Data structures (priority queues and stacks).
  - Dynamic memory management.

### 2. **Programming Assignment 3**
- A project focusing on basic file I/O operations.
- Reads and writes structured data to/from text files.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - File handling in C.
  - String manipulation.

### 3. **Programming Assignment 4**
- Implementation of basic sorting and searching algorithms.
- Features user interaction for inputting and visualizing data.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Arrays and pointers.
  - Algorithmic problem-solving.

### 4. **Programming Assignment 6**
- A simulation involving dynamic memory allocation.
- Explores linked lists and their operations.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Pointers and dynamic memory.
  - Linked list traversal and modification.

### 5. **Programming Assignment 7**
- Advanced problem-solving using recursion and backtracking.
- Focused on solving logical puzzles and pathfinding problems.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Recursive functions.
  - Backtracking techniques.

### 6. **Main File (`main.cp`)**
- A compilation of smaller exercises and examples from the course.
- Useful for understanding syntax, control flow, and basic debugging.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio).

### Compilation
Navigate to the desired project folder and compile the main source file. For example:

```bash
cd AirportProject
g++ main.cpp -o AirportSimulation
